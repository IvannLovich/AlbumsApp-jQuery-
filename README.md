# Frontend Skills Test  for Devsar

For resolve the test I used jQuery´s library. In the layout, to generate the responsive design I implemented bootstrap, flexbox and medias queries.
jQuery is not enabled to generate rendering of two views in a single page; to solve this, I used the hide()
function, so that when I clicked on the first view the content was deleted and replaced by the content of
second view.
I also found the problem of cross-origin, which I solved by installing the Chrome´s extension
"Allow-Control-Allow-Origin".
